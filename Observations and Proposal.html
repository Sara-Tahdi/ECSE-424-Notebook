        <h1>1. Project description</h1>
        <p>We are developing a smart mug/bottle/cup sleeve to solve the chronic dehydration faced by students and office workers during long hours of focused work. This sleeve features an opaque colour that gradually shifts hue if it remains untouched over a long period of time, which provides the user with a gentle reminder to drink. The system resets automatically when the user takes a sip. This approach makes use of ambient feedback, never forcefully grabbing the users attention abruptly, which is very suitable for users deeply engaged in their other day-to-day tasks.</p>

        <h1>2. User Observations</h1>
        
        <h2>2.1. Summary of Our Observation Method</h2>
        <p>The objective of our observations was to observe the hydration habits of students and what issues they encounter while trying to stay hydrated during a focused work or study session. We used a naturalistic observation structure in order to study users in their natural study environment. Our cumulative total observation periods lasted 3 hours.</p>

        <h1>3. Problem</h1>
        <p>We've collected here various points to summarize our observations and potential challenges to hydration during focused study or work sessions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The users we observed were all in a work or study session.</li>
            <li>Every single user places their bottle on the side of their work area, either on the left or the right, but always out of direct view.</li>
            <li>Some users drank once or twice, some frequently, while others never.</li>
            <li>Users had various types of bottles, of all shapes, sizes, colours, and materials, some metal, some plastic, some with twist tops, some with sliding lids, some with straws.</li>
            <li>The various users seemed to be comfortable using their respective types of water bottles.</li>
            <li>Some users drank without interrupting their work or study sessions, while others only drank while distracted during a break from their focused session, while snacking or while talking to others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, our observations show that most users frequently overlook using their water bottle in the context of a focused study or work session. Our observations also point to a reason behind this lack of hydration enthusiasm. The problem is not caused by a specific bottle design, since we see no correlation in our observations between the bottle size or lid and the frequency of usage. The problem rather depends on their level of attention while completing their tasks. If their tasks are consuming almost all of their attention, it pulls their focal point away from their personal need to hydrate and reduces their peripheral vision and consciousness. On the other hand, if they are overly distracted, users also seem to become forgetful of their hydration habits.</p>
        <p>This presents us with a great opportunity to introduce a calm ambient reminder that quickly informs the user of their hydration status and when too much time has passed without drinking. This would fulfill the needs of users at any level of focus, allowing them to remain informed of their thirst at a given point in time without requiring any concentration or for them to remain conscious of their drinking frequency. This design would fulfill the purpose of calm technology, as it would remain in the periphery of the user, information only accessible if the user seeks it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>4. Personas</h1>
        <p>Based on our observations, we extract the following types of users:</p>
        <p><strong>Persona 1:</strong> A focused user who reserves their full attention to their work or study session. They are rarely distracted, but also less aware of their surroundings or physical needs like hydration, and therefore, drink water less often. Their work sessions are deep and uninterrupted. They avoid multitasking or unnecessary movements. Their water bottle is usually out of sight or in their peripheral vision, but not in their direct line of sight. They work in silence and in a silent environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Persona 2:</strong> A user who shifts attention frequently between tasks, people, and devices. Their work or study session is frequently interrupted by another activity, such as checking their phone, eating, chatting, or switching between different tasks. They often look to be multitasking. Their water bottle is not in their line of sight and is often left forgotten. They rarely drink, likely due to their frequent shift from one task to the next. Their attention seems inconsistent.</p>
        <p><strong>Persona 3:</strong> A user who works with moderate focus while maintaining an awareness of physical needs and environment. Many of the user's tasks and actions are intentional and conscious, like taking short breaks, stretching, or drinking. Their work area seems organized, with their bottle not directly in their line of sight but always within arm's reach. They drink regularly and intentionally, without losing focus or momentum in their work. Their bottles are ergonomic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>5. Use Case Scenario</h1>
        <h3>Use case with Persona 1:</h3>
        <p>Emily is at her desk with a long to-do list and tight deadlines. She takes her mug, covered with our water tracking sleeve, and fills it up. The sleeve is a neutral colour to begin with. She takes a sip of water, and gets to her work. After around 1 hour, Emily takes a quick break from her work and sees that her mug sleeve has changed to a yellow colour, signaling that she should drink water. She drinks from her cup and the colour fades back to neutral. She continues working and notices the colour of the mug sleeve slowly fading from green to yellow to red, signaling how long she has gone without drinking water. Finally, when she sees it is red, she takes a break from her work and drinks more water, upon which the sleeve fades back to neutral. The cup sleeve reminds Emily to drink water calmly through the colour changes, and it does not disrupt her work flow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>6. Related Products</h1>
        <p>Currently, there exist a few other solutions to address the problem of remembering to stay hydrated. Apps such as WaterMinder track water intake when users log their water consumption and send reminders to drink water through phone notifications. These apps cannot operate in the periphery, as a user must keep track of and manually enter the details of how much water they have consumed. Also, the reliance of phone notifications to alert users to drink water can be disruptive.</p>
        <p>Another existing solution is the HidrateSpark water bottle. This water bottle comes in three varieties ranging from 21-32oz, and reminds users to drink water through a colourful light ring at the bottom. The bottle connects with a mobile app to automatically track water consumption and lights up to remind users to drink water. Though this solution resembles the solution we are proposing, its notification system could use improvements. A light that only shines the moment a user needs to drink more water does not gradually inform the user, it is abrupt and can be disruptive. As well, there are limited options for the bottle the user can use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>7. How Our Solution Differs</h1>
        <p>Our proposed solution calmly reminds users to drink water through colour changes, unlike related products that rely on disrupting users through notifications or bright lights. As well, by integrating this technology into a cup sleeve, users can use their own existing water bottles/mugs instead of having to use a specific type of bottle just to remind them to drink water. For Persona 1, a calm ambient reminder does not disrupt the flow of their work, but still provides enough feedback for them to be reminded to drink water. For Persona 2, the changes in colour draw their attention to their water cup/bottle/mug and remind them without distracting them. For Persona 3, the reminders they get are in line with their habits, so they integrate the bottle seamlessly into their current workflow, and the colours are an added bonus.</p>

        <h1>8. System Architecture Diagram</h1>
        
        <h3>Hardware Layer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> A pre-existing programmable board that reads the tilt sensor inputs, runs the logic and controls the LED output. The Arduino Nano is an ideal candidate due to its small size and low power consumption</li>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> A standard USB battery pack to provide power to the entire system</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor:</strong> A weighing pressure sensor that senses the change in weight of the bottle.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-fabricated Sleeve:</strong> An opaque sleeve to house the electronics and diffuse the light for the LED Strip</li>
            <li><strong>LED strips:</strong> A programmable light strip that will be wrapped around the bottle. It can be controlled to display any color and allow for smooth color shifting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software Layer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main control loop:</strong> The system is driven by a program that runs in an endless loop, performing three key functions: it reads the sensor to see if the user has taken a drink, it keeps a timer running from the last detected drink, and it uses that timer's value to slowly shift the LED color from blue to red. When a drink is detected, the program resets both the timer and the color back to the beginning, starting a new cycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>9. Feasibility</h1>
        <p>We are confident we can deliver a functional prototype by the end of the semester. We have a clear modular plan that uses available components and aligns with our team's skills. The total estimated implementation is approximately 40 hours which fits in the ballpark of 20-30 hours per member and even leaves us time for the unexpected and refinements.</p>
        <p>The project can be separated into distinct modules which allows for parallel development.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Involves soldering some components together sensor, LED strip, power and the Arduino. This is a 10 hours maximum task.</li>
            <li><strong>Software:</strong> Involve writing Arduino C++ code to read the tilt sensor, run a timer, and map the elapsed time to an LED color. Additionally, Arduino is fortunately very well documented so it should take maximum 15 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Enclosure and Aesthetics:</strong> This consists of designing and making/printing the bottle/sleeve that is able to house the electronics. This requires a few design iterations so it should take around 15 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This project is feasible as it avoids high-risk elements such as AI, custom PCBs, etc, and is built from a combination of well-understood components by our team members. The required hardware is all standard and is easy to source online. We are not pushing the boundaries of new technology but simply creatively applying existent technologies effectively to solve a common issue. This practical focus makes our goal of a semester project an achievable plan.</p>
