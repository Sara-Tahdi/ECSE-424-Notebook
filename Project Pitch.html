    <h1>Project Pitch</h1>

    <h2>Hydration Reminder Bottle</h2>
    <p>As someone who doesn't frequently feel thirsty, or have the urge to drink water, I often find myself drinking less than a cup of water per day. Hydration mainly comes from alimentation rather than the act of actively drinking. I do feel dehydration though although it is felt through drier skin or fatigue, which are subtle signs and don’t push me to drink water in the moment.</p>
    <p>This is a problem that I also notice when working with friends who are doing some focus heavy works. Although they often have a bottle nearby, it is not uncommon for the drink to be untouched for a very long period of time. Their hydration patterns seems to be dictated by focus/coding breaks rather than actual bodily needs.</p>
    <p>So I think students/office workers or people that need to do focus work for long period of time would be a good user group. Many struggle with staying hydrated because they become deeply focused on their work, often even ignoring phone reminders or timers! (as I do)</p>
    <p>So I propose a hydration reminder in the form of an opaque bottle/mug that subtly changes color over time if it hasn’t been used. The mug will shift its hue in a gradually and when the user drinks from the mug, the color resets naturally</p>
    <p>There is no subtle, physical cue that exists in the user's peripheral vision to remind them to hydrate. Unlike digital notifications that require active attention and can interrupt workflow, a physical reminder could provide continuous, non-intrusive feedback.</p>
    <p>I think prototype can be created with modest effort by embedding a simple liquid-level sensor and LED strip within a mug sleeve (so the bottle itself is untouched). The LED color can be programmed to shift on a timer when no drinking motion is detected. This requires only basic sensors and microcontroller programming.</p>
    <p>Stack wise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> familiarity with microcontrollers (Arduino or Raspberry Pi), simple sensors, and LED integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> basic programming for timer logic and state changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Other skills:</strong> Unlike phone notifications that can be ignored, this physical reminder stays in the user's peripheral vision throughout their work session.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-intrusive design:</strong> design insight to ensure the product remains aesthetically calm and not visually cluttered.</li>
    </ul>
