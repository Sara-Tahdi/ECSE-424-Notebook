        <h2>2. Title of Project</h2>
        <p>Hydration Reminder Smart Cup Sleeve</p>
        
        <h2>3. Project/Study Description (2-3 sentences)</h2>
        <p>We are developing a smart mug/bottle/cup sleeve to solve the chronic dehydration faced by students and office workers during long hours of focused work. This sleeve features an opaque colour that gradually shifts hue if it remains untouched over a long period of time, which provides the user with a gentle reminder to drink and resets automatically when the user takes a sip. This approach makes use of ambient feedback, never forcefully grabbing the users attention abruptly, which is very suitable for users deeply engaged in their other day-to-day tasks.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Number and type of participants (gender, age range, other particulars such as athletes, farmers, musicians, etc.)</h2>
        <p>We estimate that our proposal will require around 6 participants of mixed gender and age. Participants will mainly be students and workers who would engage in prolonged work or study sessions.</p>
        
        <h2>5. How and from where are they recruited</h2>
        <p>We will be recruiting participants by visiting locations such as our workplaces, the McGill libraries, and nearby coffee shops. We will approach individuals who appear to be working or studying and politely ask if they would be willing to be volunteers and participate in our research relating to hydration habits during focused work sessions and the usability of our design.</p>
        
        <h2>6. What risk could this study entail for participants?</h2>
        <p>Our research should be conducted with minimal to no risk to participants. They may be slightly inconvenienced if our research interrupts their workflow. The device could malfunction or break, which could, in an extreme circumstance, cause slight damage to the user's water bottle.</p>
        
        <h2>7. How can these risks be mitigated?</h2>
        <p>We can limit any inconvenience by keeping the study short and by ensuring they are aware that their participation may be withdrawn at any time if they wish. To prevent damage from our prototype malfunctioning, we should ensure all electronic components and hardware are properly insulated and keep supervision over the prototype during the session to monitor any abnormal behavior.</p>
